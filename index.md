For the L-train tunnel closure project, I chose to study the impact of the construction on a neighborhood in Brooklyn named Williamsburg. The neighborhood encompasses zip codes 11211 and 11206. Census tracts for the neighborhood include: 0477.00, 0489.00, 0491.00, 0493.00, 0495.00, 0497.00, 0499.00, 0501.00, 0503.00, 0505.00, 0507.00, 0509.00, 0511.00, 0513.00, 0515.00, 0517.00, 0519.00, 0523.00, 0525.00, 0527.00, 0529.00, 0531.00, 0533.00, 0535.00, 0537.00, 0539.00, 0545.00, 0547.00, 0549.00, 0551.00, 0553.00, 0555.00, 0557.00, 0569.00, 0571.00. Containing 138,984 people and 51,151 homes, Williamsburg is comprised of 56.5% White, 25.8% Hispanic, 9.5% Black, and 6.5% Asian.
